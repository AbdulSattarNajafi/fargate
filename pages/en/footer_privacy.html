                  <h4>Introduction</h4>
                  <p>
                    Visitors to this website and all other external reference
                    persons of Fargate AG (&#171;<strong>Fargate</strong>&#187;)
                    are referred to below as
                    &#171;<strong>customers</strong>&#187;.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The contents of this website are exclusively for persons to
                    whom Swiss law applies. All personal data are therefore
                    subject to the Swiss Data Protection Act.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fargate takes the protection of their customers' personal
                    data very seriously, treating personal data confidentially,
                    in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations
                    and this privacy policy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This website does not offer users the possibility to enter
                    personal data that is worth protecting, and therefore does
                    not store any of them.
                  </p>
                  <p>All contents of this website are adult.</p>
                  <h4>How does Fargate handle personal information?</h4>
                  <p>
                    Fargate does not disclose personally identifiable
                    information from customers without the consent of third
                    parties.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The use of this website is possible without providing
                    personal data such as name, address or e-mail address. There
                    is no possibility for users to log in to this website
                    (login) or to register.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fargate does not store personal data through this website
                    except when the user signs up for the Fargate newsletter
                    (opt-in). The user explicitly enters his e-mail address and
                    optionally his name, company and postal address in a form on
                    this website. These user data are subsequently used
                    exclusively for the delivery of Fargate newsletters to this
                    user, whereby the user can stop the delivery permanently
                    after every receipt of a newsletter by simply clicking on an
                    obvious link in the footer line (opt-out). Fargate does not
                    use this website to collect further personal data by means
                    of forms.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fargate can not establish a link between personal data (such
                    as email address) and personal data (such as IP addresses)
                    of its users and draw conclusions about individuals. Fargate
                    does not know which people visited which page of this
                    website as often.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition, a customer can contact Fargate via e-mail,
                    letter or phone via Fargate's contact addresses listed on
                    this website or elsewhere, using Fargate's customary
                    personal data (e-mail signature, business card, letterhead,
                    etc.) comunicate. The customer hereby expressly agrees that
                    Fargate may communicate with the user within a bilateral
                    dialogue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fargate exchanges information with any customer (not just
                    users of this website) through individual, bilateral
                    communication via e-mail, telephone or face-to-face with
                    mutual consent as part of a regular business relationship.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Google Search and Google Analytics</h4>
                  <p>
                    This website uses Google Search elements to help users find
                    this site in relevant search results from major search
                    engines. The search results contain an external link to the
                    respective page of this website.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In addition, this website uses code elements from Google
                    Analytics to statistically evaluate the use of the website
                    (for example, which pages have been visited the most) and to
                    improve them for the benefit of users. Based on this
                    information, Fargate knows which pages, search terms and
                    content are important and relevant to users. Fargate uses
                    this information to continually refine the site, improving
                    its users' positive website experience.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Google is one of the world's leading search engine providers
                    in the US, which also operates its servers in the USA.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Social Media</h4>
                  <p>
                    Fargate announces news to its users only via individual
                    e-mails and letters, e-newsletters, Linkedin, Xing,
                    Facebook, Twitter, Google and Instagram. The posts used in
                    social media platforms contain an external link to the
                    respective page of this website wherever possible and
                    useful.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, no social media platforms are more closely linked
                    to this website. Fargate refrains from directly integrating
                    such social media platforms on this website. Any connection
                    to and from such systems will always be via a normal
                    external link that can be viewed by the user and explicitly
                    clicked.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    On social media platforms, communication takes place
                    according to the usual rules. Thus, the privacy statements
                    valid there are authoritative.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Cookies</h4>
                  <p>
                    Websites usually use so-called cookies. These set up no
                    damage on the computer of the user and contain no viruses.
                    Cookies are used to make this website more user-friendly,
                    effective and secure. Cookies are small text files that are
                    stored by the browser on the computer. These cookies make it
                    possible, for example, to recognize the respective browser
                    of a user during their next visit to this website and to
                    opt-in or opt-out of it as they did on their last visit.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The user can set his browser so that he is informed about
                    the setting of cookies. He may specifically allow or deny
                    cookies, exclude the assumptions of cookies for certain
                    cases or in general, and activate the automatic deletion of
                    cookies when closing the browser. However, disabling cookies
                    may limit the functionality of the site.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Fargate uses cookies and explicitly informs the user when
                    the website is called for the first time.
                  </p>

                    personal data?

                  <p>
                    This website and the e-mails to and from Fargate are hosted
                    by the Swiss Internet provider

                    In order for the pages of this website to be sent to the
                    correct end device of the website user, Iway.ch must know
                    the user's IP address. Between the sending and displaying of
                    individual pages, information is stored locally on the
                    user's terminal. This procedure is common practice and
                    necessary for the seamless continuation of website use in
                    the interest of the user. The corresponding information is
                    stored on the user's computer by means of cookies (see
                    above) and queried on his next visit to this website.
                    Iway.ch automatically collects and stores information that
                    is relevant for website operation in so-called server log
                    files. This information is automatically transmitted to the
                    website by the user's browser. These are, for example,
                    browser type, browser version, operating system, URL, host
                    name of the accessing computer or the time of the server
                    request.

                    Fargate does not merge this data with other data sources and

                    however, to have this data reviewed by Iway.ch at a later
                    date if there are concrete indications of illegal use.
